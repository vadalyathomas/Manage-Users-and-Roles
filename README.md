# Manage-Users-and-Roles with Active Directory

In this Lab, I configured access control for multiple administrators (NSX-Admin, NSX-Auditor, and NSX-Network). I created groups in Active Directory (AD), and then added users to the new groups. Next, I added Active Directory as an identity source in the NSX manager. Finally, I assigned user groups to the pre-defined roles available in NSX (Network Virtualization and Security Platform, a VMWare product), and then I inserted and tested the various permissions.
